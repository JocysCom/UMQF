## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** [X]% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** [Linear Label] [Fidelity Label]
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** [Y] (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +[Sum of Positive UMQ] ([X]% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -[Sum of Negative UMQ] ([Y]% of total magnitude)
<!-- Template Only Notes:
- **Scoring Rule**: Include all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`. This includes actions performed in a simulation if the entity believed they were real, as these reveal true character. Exclude actions where `PerceivedContext = Simulation`.
- Usefulness: Highlights the entity's core moral value at the top, allowing readers to immediately gauge safety/risk in potential interactions.
- Usage: For survival, positive scores suggest safe alliances; negative ones warn of harm—e.g., avoid entities with highly immoral ratings to prevent betrayal or attack.
- For non-conscious/non-self-aware entities: Use programmed behaviors to predict aid/hinder potential.
-->

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** [High-level analysis of the entity's moral character]
- **Confidence Forecast:** [e.g., "Forecast: 85% beneficial..."]
<!-- Template Only Notes: 
- Usefulness: Delivers high-density overview of key traits and forecasts, enabling quick decisions without reading the full report.
- Usage: In crises, scan for survival forecasts (e.g., "beneficial ally") to decide approach/avoid; aliens/AI can use analogies for cross-species relevance.
- For non-conscious/non-self-aware entities: Emphasize functional predictions to assess utility.
-->

## Notes and Assumptions

- [Explicit assumptions affecting scoring or roles]

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- [Assumptions and confidence levels]
<!-- Template Only Notes: 
- Usefulness: Flags uncertainties, helping readers adjust trust in the report.
- Usage: For survival, discount low-confidence data in high-risk decisions.
- For non-conscious/non-self-aware entities: Notes on observational limits prevent over-reliance.
-->

## Historical Impact

- [Historical impact summary]
<!-- Template Only Notes: 
- Usefulness: Summarizes past effects, providing evidence-based predictions for future utility.
- Usage: Use to gauge scalability—e.g., if immediate impacts are positive, scale to group alliances.
- For non-conscious/non-self-aware entities: Tracks deployment history for pattern recognition.
-->

<!-- Template Only Notes: General Usage Guidelines
- **Cooperation for UMQ Maximization**: Align voluntarily with entity motivations/relationships for mutual benefits; avoid force to prevent resistance and negative UMQ.
- **Mimicry and Learning Risks**: Entities may adopt strategies from reports—share selectively to avoid stronger ones exploiting weaker parties or reducing your survival odds.
- **Non-Conscious/Non-Self-Aware Handling**: For owned/programmed entities, check ownership before reprogramming to evade conflicts; focus on symbiotic use for positive UMQ without violations.
- **Cross-Section Application**: Combine UMQ/VSA with forecasts for holistic predictions; recalibrate for reader ethics to ensure universal relevance.
- **Citation Standard**: Use ISO 690 standard for all references: “{statement_or_quote}” ({creator}[, *{short_title}*], {year}[, p. {page_or_pages}]).
