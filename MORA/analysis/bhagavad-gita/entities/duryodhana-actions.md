# Morality Assessment: Duryodhana

## Case 1. Duryodhana - instigating war - Humanity

### Entity list

1. Humanity (Warriors/Civilians) (1,700,000+)
2. Pandavas (5)
3. Social Order (Dharma)

### 1 Humanity (1.7M) - death and destruction

Context: Duryodhana is the primary instigator of the war. His refusal to give even "five villages" to the Pandavas, despite their legitimate claim and offers of peace, makes him directly responsible for the conflict.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent of the victims of his ambition)
- Sc = 0.80 (Suffering of war)

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.8 = **-2.088**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active - decision maker)
- Cp = 1.0 (Immediate - his refusal was the trigger)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - he was the sole obstacle to peace)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended war to destroy rivals)

UMQ_final = -2.088 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **-2.088**

Total for 1,700,000 = **-3,549,600**

### 2 Pandavas (5) - dispossession and attempted murder

Context: He sought to kill them (wax palace), humiliate them (Draupadi), and deny their rights.

- ΔOS = -0.80 (Loss of status, exile, risk of death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 0.50 (Years of exile)
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.80

UMQ_base = -0.80 × 0.58 × 0.50 × 2.0 × 1.8 = **-0.8352**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **-0.8352**

Total for 5 = **-4.176**

### 3 Social Order (Dharma) - destruction

Context: His actions violated the principles of kingship and justice, leading to the Kali Yuga.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Destruction of righteous order)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.50

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.5 = **-1.74**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **-1.74**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Humanity: -3,549,600
- Pandavas: -4.176
- Social Order: -1.74

**Total UMQ = -3,549,606**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = **-3,549,606**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Duryodhana) ≈ +1.00 (Absolute power, removal of rivals).
- UMQ_realised(a, Duryodhana) ≈ -1.00 (Death, destruction of lineage, eternal infamy).

### Summary headline

Duryodhana - instigating war - Humanity: Total UMQ = -3,549,606 [Catastrophically immoral] {Predatory}
