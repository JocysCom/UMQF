## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.0 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Dhritarashtra represents the blindness of attachment ("Moha"). Physically blind, he is also spiritually blind to the righteousness of the Pandavas due to his excessive love for his son Duryodhana. He is the passive enabler of the conflict. While he does not fight personally, his failure to exercise his authority as King to prevent the injustice makes him morally culpable for the entire war. He constantly seeks reassurance from Sanjaya but fails to act on the wisdom provided.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 95% likely to choose his son's interest over justice until it is too late.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. He simulates the war through Sanjaya's eyes but feels anxiety rather than moral revulsion.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward (Short-term). He hopes for his son's victory.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. He knows the Dharma but cannot inhibit his attachment.
- **Gap Analysis:** High gap between his knowledge (via Vidura/Bhisma) and his actions.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.5800
- **Rationale:** Average human king, intelligent but morally compromised.

## Background

- **Philosophy:** Opportunistic.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Remembered as the King whose blindness destroyed the Kuru dynasty.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Do not rely on him for justice:** He is compromised by nepotism.
2. **Appeal to fear:** He is anxious about defeat; this is the only lever to move him.

## Consent Indicators

- "O Sanjaya, tell me what my people and the Pandavas... did?" (Dhritarashtra, *Bhagavad Gita*, 1:1).

## Suffering Indicators

- "My heart is drying up" (Implied in his anxiety throughout the narration).

## Evidence References

- "Mamakah" (My people) vs "Pandavah" (Sons of Pandu) - reveals his divisive mindset in the very first verse (1:1).

## Notes and Assumptions

- **Assumption:** His culpability is rated at 0.5 (Passive/Instrumental) but the scale of the event makes the score massive.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.
