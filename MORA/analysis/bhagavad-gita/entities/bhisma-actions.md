# Morality Assessment: Bhisma

## Case 1. Bhisma - fighting for Kauravas - Pandavas

### Entity list

1. Pandava Army (700,000)
2. Kaurava Army (1,000,000)
3. Social Order (Dharma)

### 1 Pandava Army (700k) - death and destruction

Context: Bhisma, the "Grandsire," fights for the Kauravas due to his vow of loyalty to the throne of Hastinapura, despite knowing the Pandavas are righteous. He kills thousands of Pandava warriors daily.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00 (War context)
- Sc = 0.80

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.8 = **-1.044**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - Supreme commander)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended to fight, though heart was not in it)

UMQ_final = **-1.044**

Total for 700,000 = **-730,800**

### 2 Kaurava Army (1M) - leadership

Context: His leadership prolongs the war, leading to more deaths on his own side as well.

- ΔOS = -0.50 (Prolonged exposure to death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.50

UMQ_base = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.5 = **-0.435**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 0.5 (Foreseeable)

UMQ_final = **-0.2175**

Total for 1,000,000 = **-217,500**

### 3 Social Order (Dharma) - adherence to vow

Context: Bhisma upholds the Dharma of keeping one's word (Satya), even when it leads to Adharma (supporting evil).

- ΔOS = +0.20 (Example of integrity)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base = +0.20 × 0.58 × 1.0 = **+0.116**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **+0.116**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Pandavas: -730,800
- Kauravas: -217,500
- Social Order: +0.116

**Total UMQ = -948,300**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.2 (Extreme moral complexity of his vow). Adjusted Total UMQ = **-1,137,960**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Bhisma) ≈ -0.50 (Expected death and release).
- UMQ_realised(a, Bhisma) ≈ +0.50 (Death by own will, spiritual release).

### Summary headline

Bhisma - fighting for Kauravas - Pandavas: Total UMQ = -1,137,960 [Catastrophically immoral] {Destructive}
