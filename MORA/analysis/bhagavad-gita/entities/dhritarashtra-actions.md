# Morality Assessment: Dhritarashtra

## Case 1. Dhritarashtra - allowing war - Humanity

### Entity list

1. Humanity (Warriors/Civilians) (1,700,000)
2. Social Order (Dharma)

### 1 Humanity (1.7M) - death and destruction

Context: Dhritarashtra, as the King, had the authority to stop the war by curbing his son Duryodhana's ambition and returning the Pandavas' kingdom. His attachment to his son and passive permission led to the slaughter.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00 (Victims did not consent to an unjust war started by greed)
- Sc = 0.80 (Suffering of war)

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.8 = **-2.088**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 0.5 (Instrumental Passive - failure to exercise authority)
- Cp = 0.5 (Direct Consequence - his permission was the final gate)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - only the King could stop the Prince)
- Rp = 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 = **0.25**
- In = 0.5 (Foreseeable negligence - warned by Vidura, Bhisma, Krishna)

UMQ_final = -2.088 × 0.25 × 0.5 = **-0.261**

Total for 1,700,000 = **-443,700**

### 2 Social Order (Dharma) - degradation

Context: By allowing injustice to prevail in his court, he degraded the moral order of the kingdom.

- ΔOS = -0.50 (Corruption of justice)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 0.50
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.10

UMQ_base = -0.50 × 0.58 × 0.50 × 2.0 × 1.1 = **-0.319**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 0.5
- Cp = 0.5
- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 0.25
- In = 0.5

UMQ_final = -0.319 × 0.25 × 0.5 = **-0.0398**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Humanity: -443,700
- Social Order: -0.0398

**Total UMQ = -443,700**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = **-443,700**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Dhritarashtra) ≈ +0.10 (Hoped for his son's victory and kingdom retention).
- UMQ_realised(a, Dhritarashtra) ≈ -0.90 (Loss of all sons, grief, loss of kingdom).

### Summary headline

Dhritarashtra - allowing war - Humanity: Total UMQ = -443,700 [Catastrophically immoral] {Destructive}

## Case 2. Dhritarashtra - attempted murder - Bhima

### Entity list

1. Bhima (1)

### 1 Bhima - attempted crushing

Context: After the war, Dhritarashtra asks to embrace Bhima but intends to crush him to death with his superhuman strength. Krishna substitutes an iron statue, which Dhritarashtra crushes to powder.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death intended)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent)
- Sc = 0.00 (No actual suffering as it was a statue, but intent was full suffering)

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.0 = **-1.16**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real (He thought he was crushing Bhima)
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0 (Immediate)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended)

UMQ_final = -1.16 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **-1.16**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Bhima: -1.16

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = **-1.16**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Dhritarashtra) ≈ +0.10 (Revenge satisfaction).
- UMQ_realised(a, Dhritarashtra) ≈ -0.50 (Shame and remorse when he realized he crushed a statue and his anger was spent).

### Summary headline

Dhritarashtra - attempted murder - Bhima: Total UMQ = -1.16 [Highly immoral] {Destructive}

## Multi-Case Summary

1. **Dhritarashtra - allowing war - Humanity:** -443,700 [Catastrophically immoral] {Destructive}
2. **Dhritarashtra - attempted murder - Bhima:** -1.16 [Highly immoral] {Destructive}
