# Morality Assessment: Drona

## Case 1. Drona - fighting for Kauravas - Pandavas

### Entity list

1. Pandava Army (700,000)
2. Kaurava Army (1,000,000)
3. Social Order (Dharma)

### 1 Pandava Army (700k) - death and destruction

Context: Drona, the teacher of both the Pandavas and Kauravas, fights for the Kauravas because he is financially beholden to the King ("Arthasya Purusho Dasah" - Man is a slave to wealth). He uses divine weapons against common soldiers.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00 (War context)
- Sc = 0.80

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.8 = **-1.044**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - Supreme commander after Bhisma)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended to fight)

UMQ_final = **-1.044**

Total for 700,000 = **-730,800**

### 2 Kaurava Army (1M) - leadership

Context: His leadership prolongs the war.

- ΔOS = -0.50
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.50

UMQ_base = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.5 = **-0.435**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 0.5

UMQ_final = **-0.2175**

Total for 1,000,000 = **-217,500**

### 3 Social Order (Dharma) - violation of Brahmanical duty

Context: As a Brahman, his duty was teaching and austerity, not war for profit. His participation degrades the caste system's moral structure.

- ΔOS = -0.50 (Corruption of Varna Dharma)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.10

UMQ_base = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.1 = **-0.638**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **-0.638**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Pandavas: -730,800
- Kauravas: -217,500
- Social Order: -0.638

**Total UMQ = -948,300**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.1 (Conflict of duty). Adjusted Total UMQ = **-1,043,130**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Drona) ≈ +0.20 (Repayment of debt, protection of son Ashwatthama).
- UMQ_realised(a, Drona) ≈ -1.00 (Death by deception, loss of reputation).

### Summary headline

Drona - fighting for Kauravas - Pandavas: Total UMQ = -1,043,130 [Catastrophically immoral] {Destructive}
