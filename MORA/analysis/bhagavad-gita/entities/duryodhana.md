## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Duryodhana is the antagonist of the epic, driven by envy ("Matsarya") and greed ("Lobha"). He is the embodiment of the Kali Yuga (Age of Vice). His refusal to share the kingdom, despite having no legitimate claim to the whole, and his repeated attempts to destroy his cousins, make him a purely predatory entity. He is intelligent and a capable warrior, but his moral compass is inverted—he sees his own ambition as the only law.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% likely to choose conflict over compromise.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. He derives pleasure from the suffering of his enemies (e.g., Draupadi's humiliation).
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He actively pursues war.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** None. He has no internal check on his ambition.
- **Gap Analysis:** None. He acts exactly as he desires.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
