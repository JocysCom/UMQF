### 1 Pandava Army (700k) - death and destruction

Context: Karna fights with full force against the Pandavas, despite knowing they are his brothers, to fulfill his debt of loyalty to Duryodhana.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00 (War context)
- Sc = 0.80

UMQ_base = -1.00 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.8 = **-1.044**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - his skill rivals Arjuna's)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **-1.044**

Total for 700,000 = **-730,800**

### 2 Duryodhana (1) - loyalty/support

Context: Karna provides the critical moral and physical support that emboldens Duryodhana to go to war.

- ΔOS = +0.50 (Political survival/Confidence)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 0.50
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base = +0.50 × 0.58 × 0.50 = **+0.145**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **+0.145**

### 3 Social Order (Dharma) - violation

Context: By supporting an unrighteous king against the righteous Pandavas, he contributes to the decline of Dharma.

- ΔOS = -0.50
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.10

UMQ_base = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.1 = **-0.638**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final = **-0.638**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Pandavas: -730,800
- Duryodhana: +0.145
- Social Order: -0.638

**Total UMQ = -730,800**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.1 (Complex loyalty vs. morality). Adjusted Total UMQ = **-803,880**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Karna) ≈ +0.50 (Glory, repayment of debt).
- UMQ_realised(a, Karna) ≈ -1.00 (Death, tragedy).
