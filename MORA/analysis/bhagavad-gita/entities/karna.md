## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Karna is a tragic figure defined by his immense generosity ("Dana") and his misplaced loyalty. Rejected by society due to his perceived low caste, he clings to Duryodhana, the only person who offered him status and friendship. This loyalty blinds him to the unrighteousness of Duryodhana's cause. He is a warrior of equal caliber to Arjuna but is doomed by curses and his own choices. His moral efficiency is catastrophic because his skills are deployed in service of a destructive war.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% loyal to Duryodhana, even unto death.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. He knows the Pandavas are righteous (especially after Kunti's revelation) but feels bound by debt.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward (Honor). He values his word above his life.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** High for personal honor, Low for moral righteousness.
- **Gap Analysis:** He acts against his own knowledge of Dharma out of loyalty.
