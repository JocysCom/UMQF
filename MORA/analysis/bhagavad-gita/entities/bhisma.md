## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Bhisma is the patriarch of the Kuru dynasty, a man of terrible vows ("Bhisma Pratigya"). He renounced the throne and marriage to ensure his father's happiness. However, his rigid adherence to his vow of loyalty to the throne of Hastinapura forces him to fight on the side of Adharma (the Kauravas), despite knowing the Pandavas are righteous. He represents the tragedy of placing personal vows above the greater good.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% reliable in battle until his self-chosen death.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Penalty. He grieves for the Pandavas whom he loves.
- **Action Alignment:** Neutral/Penalty. He fights out of duty, not desire.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** High. He restrains his full power to avoid wiping out the Pandavas instantly, waiting for them to kill him.
- **Gap Analysis:** High gap between his heart (Pandavas) and his hand (Kauravas).

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.
