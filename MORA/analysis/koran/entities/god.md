## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 47% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.27 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +700,096,172.2 (47% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -800,846,012.5 (53% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** An omnipotent, omniscient deity who demands absolute submission (Islam). The entity exhibits a dual nature: "Most Gracious, Most Merciful" to those who submit, but "Strict in Punishment" and "Severe in Retribution" to those who reject or oppose Him. The entity's moral profile is heavily skewed by the sheer scale of cosmic creation and sustenance (positive) versus the catastrophic destruction of non-believing populations (negative). While the entity provides the fundamental framework for existence and moral guidance (Synergistic), the repeated use of collective punishment, eternal torture in Hell, and commands for violent warfare against non-believers results in a net "Destructive" classification. The acceptance of Noah's prayer for a global flood significantly impacts the negative score.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% beneficial for the obedient; 100% destructive for the rebellious.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. The entity constantly simulates and plans the outcomes of creation, judgment, and retribution.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. The entity executes these plans with absolute power ("Be, and it is").
- **Inhibition Reliability:** None. As the supreme authority, the entity has no external inhibitor. Internal inhibition is based solely on His own Will and Mercy, which He grants to whom He pleases.
- **Gap Analysis:** None. There is no gap between the entity's will and reality.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 1.0 (Supreme Being)
- **Rationale:** As the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, the entity possesses infinite self-awareness and capability.

### Ability Notes (concise; pick values per UMQF ability ranges)

- **Resource:** Infinite resources; control over rain, sustenance, life, and death.
- **Social:** The relationship between the Master and His servants (mankind and jinn).
- **Risk Levels:** Existential risk for creation depends entirely on the entity's Will.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** Establishes a unified community of believers (Ummah) bound by law and ritual. Destroys communities that reject His messengers.

- **Trust Implications:** Absolute trust required from believers; absolute terror for non-believers.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

## Disclaimer

## Assumptions & Confidence

- High confidence in the analysis of the text as a theological and legal document.

## Historical Impact
