### 1 Coburg Workers - victims of SA violence

Context: In October 1922, Hitler led 800 stormtroopers to a "German Day" in Coburg, instructing them to ignore police bans and march with unfurled banners. When workers insulted them, the Nazis "leapt out of the ranks beating their tormentors with sticks and rubber-truncheons," resulting in a "furious battle" and ten minutes of mayhem.

### 2 Munich Police & Putschists - victims of Beer Hall Putsch

Context: On November 8-9, 1923, Hitler led an armed attempt to seize power in Munich, declaring a "national revolution" and marching 2,000 armed men through the city. The coup ended in a shootout at the Odeonsplatz where "fourteen putschists and four policemen lay dead," and Hitler fled the scene.

### 3 German Readers - victims of *Mein Kampf* propaganda

Context: While imprisoned in Landsberg in 1924, Hitler wrote *Mein Kampf*, a book that crystallized his "world-view" of racial struggle and antisemitism. The text served as a tool for "psychological corruption," poisoning the minds of millions with hatred and preparing the ideological ground for future war and genocide.

### 4 NSDAP Members - victims of authoritarian reorganization

Context: In July 1921, Hitler resigned from the party to force the committee's hand, demanding "dictatorial powers" as the condition for his return. He successfully imposed a new constitution that abolished internal democracy, granting him "sole responsibility" and absolute authority over the movement.

100,000 × -0.2088 = **-20,880**

### 5 Geli Raubal - victim of psychological abuse

Context: Hitler's niece, Geli Raubal, was subjected to his "intense psychological pressure" and "domineering possessiveness," effectively becoming a prisoner in his apartment. Desperate to escape his clutches, she committed suicide in September 1931, an act driven by the "vice of her uncle's clammy possessiveness."

UMQ_final(a,e) = -1.9836 × 0.25 × 0.5 = **-0.24795 (Highly immoral)**

### 6 German Democracy - victim of subversion

Context: Following his appointment as Chancellor in January 1933, Hitler rapidly dismantled the Weimar Republic through the "Enabling Act" of March 1933, which allowed him to rule by decree. This act, passed amidst intimidation, marked the end of parliamentary democracy and the beginning of the "Führer state."

### 7 German Citizens - victims of suspension of civil liberties

Context: Using the pretext of the Reichstag fire in February 1933, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to sign the "Decree for the Protection of People and State," which suspended all personal liberties indefinitely. This decree became the "charter of the Third Reich," allowing for arbitrary arrest and the elimination of basic rights.

### 21 European Jews - victims of the Final Solution

Context: Hitler's "prophecy" of January 1939 linked the outbreak of war with the "annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe." This ideological obsession translated into the systematic mass murder of European Jews, beginning with the Einsatzgruppen shootings in the East and culminating in the industrial slaughter of the death camps. In his final Political Testament, he exhorted the German people to "merciless resistance" against "international Jewry," blaming them for the war and its destruction.

### 24 German Soldiers - victims of strategic incompetence and "Halt Order"

Context: In the winter crisis of 1941-42, Hitler issued a "fanatical" order to stand fast, forbidding retreat despite the desperate condition of his troops. While arguably preventing a rout, this "Halt Order" condemned thousands of ill-equipped soldiers to death and frostbite in the Russian winter.

### 25 German Civilian Population - victims of Nero Decree & War Prolongation

Context: In March 1945, Hitler issued the "Nero Decree," ordering the destruction of all industrial and transport infrastructure within the Reich to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. He declared that if the war was lost, the German people had proved themselves the "weaker" and deserved to perish, showing a total disregard for their survival. He refused to capitulate, prolonging the war and causing immense civilian suffering and death.

### 26 Italian Soldiers - victims of betrayal and captivity

Context: Following Italy's armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Hitler ordered the disarming and internment of Italian soldiers. Over 650,000 were taken into German captivity, where they were treated as "military internees" rather than POWs and subjected to forced labour and harsh conditions.

### 28 German Nation - victims of abandonment via suicide

Context: On April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide in his bunker as Soviet troops closed in. By choosing to die rather than capitulate, he abandoned the German people to total defeat and occupation, having previously stated that if they could not win, they deserved to be "extinguished." He left a legacy of "ruination – physical and moral" associated with his name.

Adjusted Total UMQ = **-207,032,921**

### Actor (self) impact

• UMQ_expected(a, Hitler) ≈ +0.5 (Hitler believed these actions would secure his power, fulfill his ideological mission, and ensure the survival/dominance of the Aryan race, which he equated with his own success).
• UMQ_realised(a, Hitler) = -1.0 (Suicide, total destruction of his Reich, permanent infamy).

Hitler's actions were driven by a delusion that extreme immorality towards others would result in the highest good for himself and his "Volk". The reality was total self-destruction and the ruin of the nation he claimed to serve.
