### Actor (self) impact

• UMQ_expected(a, Hitler) ≈ +0.5 (Hitler believed these actions would secure his power, fulfill his ideological mission, and ensure the survival/dominance of the Aryan race, which he equated with his own success).
• UMQ_realised(a, Hitler) = -1.0 (Suicide, total destruction of his Reich, permanent infamy).

Hitler's actions were driven by a delusion that extreme immorality towards others would result in the highest good for himself and his "Volk". The reality was total self-destruction and the ruin of the nation he claimed to serve.
