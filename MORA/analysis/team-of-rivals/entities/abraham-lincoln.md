- **Inhibition Reliability:** High. He possesses iron self-control, often writing angry letters that he never sends ("hot letters") to vent his feelings without causing damage.
- **Gap Analysis:** Minimal gap between his moral compass and his actions, though he is often constrained by political and military realities.

## Reader Interaction Forecast
- A reader interacting with Lincoln would find him accessible, unpretentious, and deeply human. He would likely disarm any tension with a humorous story or a self-deprecating remark. However, beneath the genial exterior, one would sense a core of steel and a profound melancholy. He would listen intently, treating the reader as an equal, but would not be easily swayed from his convictions.
