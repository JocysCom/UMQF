## Identification

- ID: E0001
- Name: Henry Jekyll
- Type: human
- Role tags: actor | victim
- Time Period: Late 19th Century
- Document: The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde
- Reviewer: Roo Code

## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 13.5% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.06 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +0.116 (13.5% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -0.744 (86.5% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Dr. Jekyll is a complex figure defined by his "profound duplicity of life." While outwardly a charitable and respectable gentleman, his internal struggle with his "lower elements" leads him to create a method to separate them. This act, born of scientific hubris and a desire to indulge his vices without consequence, ultimately unleashes a force of pure evil (Hyde) that he cannot control. His moral character is deeply flawed by this initial decision to prioritize his own gratification and reputation over public safety, though he attempts to redeem himself through charity and eventual self-sacrifice.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 10% beneficial. While capable of great good, his instability and connection to Hyde make him an extreme risk.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. Jekyll derives "heady recklessness" and delight from the freedom of his Hyde persona initially.
- **Action Alignment:** Penalty. In his own person, he feels remorse and terror at Hyde's actions, eventually leading to despair.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. His ability to resist the transformation degrades over time until it becomes involuntary.
- **Gap Analysis:** Significant. Jekyll values his reputation and moral standing (Action Alignment) but secretly craves the uninhibited freedom of Hyde (Simulation Alignment), creating a fatal dissonance.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.5800
- **Rationale:** Jekyll demonstrates high intelligence and scientific capability (Advanced/Complex) but is average in other human metrics.

### Ability Notes

- Recognition: 0.08 (Advanced)
- Solving: 0.09 (Advanced)
- Simulation: 0.09 (Advanced)
- Planning: 0.09 (Advanced)
- Adaptation: 0.05 (Advanced)
- Communication: 0.09 (Advanced)
- Actions: 0.09 (Complex)

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** Victorian London; a society of strict social stratification and moral repression.
- **Resource:** Wealthy, well-connected, access to scientific equipment and chemicals.
- **Social:** Highly respected doctor, surrounded by loyal friends (Utterson, Lanyon) and servants.
- **Risk Levels:** Extreme. His experiments pose a direct lethal threat to himself and an indirect lethal threat to the public.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** His creation of Hyde introduces a predator into the community, causing fear and death. His charitable works offer some mitigation but do not outweigh the harm.
- **Non-human Life:** Minimal direct impact.
- **Trust Implications:** Destroys trust within his inner circle (Lanyon) and represents a betrayal of the medical profession's "do no harm" principle.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- A typical human would likely find Jekyll charming and respectable initially but would be in grave danger if the transformation were to occur. Authority figures would view him as a tragic but criminally negligent figure.

## Key Actions

| Action | Target | Score | Interaction Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Creating potion | Society | -0.0010 | Destructive |
| Shielding Hyde | Utterson | -0.0010 | Destructive |
| Shielding Hyde | Potential Victims | -0.0007 | Destructive |
| Charitable works | Poor of London (100) | +0.0580 | Synergistic |
| Traumatizing Lanyon | Dr. Lanyon | -0.7410 | Predatory |
| Resisting Hyde | Society | +0.0580 | Altruistic |

## Background

- Born to a large fortune, Henry Jekyll was inclined to industry and the respect of the wise. However, he concealed his "impatient gaiety" and "irregularities" to maintain a grave public countenance. This suppression led him to scientific inquiries into the duality of man.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Scientific curiosity, desire for social respect, desire for uninhibited pleasure.
- **Philosophy:** Believed that man is not truly one, but two, and that separating these natures would relieve life of "all that was unbearable."
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** N/A (Deceased).

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** Strong friendships with Utterson and Lanyon; loyal servant Poole.
- **Betrayal Risks:** High. He deceives all of them to protect his secret.
- **Loyalty Forecast:** Unreliable due to his dual nature.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** High social intelligence, scientific expertise.
- **Tech Use:** Advanced chemical synthesis.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- His legacy is one of caution against scientific hubris and the dangers of repressed duality. He leaves behind a trail of destruction (Carew, Lanyon, himself) and a shattered reputation.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. Do not engage in experiments that alter personality or consciousness without rigorous safety protocols.
2. Prioritize transparency with trusted peers (like Lanyon) over secrecy.
3. Address internal psychological conflicts through integration rather than dissociation.
4. Avoid shielding dangerous entities/personas from justice.

## Consent Indicators

- "I concealed my pleasures" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Suffering Indicators

- "The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "I am very low, Utterson... very low" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Evidence References

- "Man is not truly one, but truly two" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Notes and Assumptions

- Assumed VSA values based on text descriptions of intelligence and capability.
- Assumed "Poor of London" beneficiaries to be approximately 100 for the calculation of charitable impact.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- Confidence in action analysis is High, based on explicit textual evidence.
- Confidence in VSA scoring is Medium-High.

## Historical Impact

- Jekyll's case serves as a primary case study in the UMQF database for "Internal Duality" and "Unintended Consequences of Self-Modification."
