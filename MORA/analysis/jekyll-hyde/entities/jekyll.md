## Identification

- ID: E0001
- Name: Henry Jekyll
- Type: human
- Role tags: actor | victim
- Time Period: Late 19th Century (Victorian)
- Document: The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde
- Reviewer: Roo

## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 13.5%
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.06
- **Positive (Good):** +0.116 (13.5% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -0.744 (86.5% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Dr. Henry Jekyll is a tragic figure defined by his ambition to separate the dual nature of man. While he possesses a strong desire to do good and maintain a respectable social standing, his hubris and inability to accept his own flaws lead him to unleash a pure evil (Hyde) upon the world. His moral trajectory is a steep decline; despite periods of charitable redemption, his ultimate legacy is one of destruction—killing his friend Lanyon via trauma and eventually destroying himself. He is a "Highly Destructive" entity not through malice, but through the catastrophic consequences of his metaphysical gambling.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% Destructive (Final State). Jekyll is deceased, having sacrificed himself to contain Hyde.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. Jekyll intellectually explores the concept of evil without immediate revulsion, viewing it as a scientific problem to be solved.
- **Action Alignment:** Penalty. He feels intense remorse ("tears of gratitude and remorse") after Hyde's atrocities, yet is addicted to the freedom Hyde provides.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. He repeatedly succumbs to the temptation of becoming Hyde, even after knowing the dangers ("I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it").
- **Gap Analysis:** Jekyll values high moral standing but lacks the inhibition to suppress his lower urges without separating them entirely.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.75
- **Rationale:** A highly intelligent and educated man, capable of complex scientific breakthroughs and deep philosophical introspection.

### Ability Notes

- Recognition: 0.11 (Complex)
- Solving: 0.12 (Advanced)
- Simulation: 0.13 (Advanced)
- Planning: 0.13 (Advanced)
- Adaptation: 0.06 (Advanced)
- Communication: 0.12 (Advanced)
- Actions: 0.08 (Advanced)

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** Wealthy Victorian London; high social status and professional respect.
- **Resource:** High. Access to significant wealth, property, and scientific materials.
- **Social:** Embedded in a network of respectable professionals (Utterson, Lanyon).
- **Risk Levels:** Extreme. His secret existence as Hyde poses a lethal threat to the community.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** Destabilized public safety through the release of a murderer; eroded trust among his circle.
- **Non-human Life:** N/A
- **Trust Implications:** Demonstrates that even the most respectable figures may harbor destructive secrets.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- A typical human would find Jekyll charming and respectable in his normal state, but would be in grave danger if he were to transform or if his secret were probed too deeply.

## Key Actions

| Action | Target | Score | Interaction Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Creating potion | Society | -0.0010 | Destructive |
| Shielding Hyde | Utterson/Victims | -0.0017 | Destructive |
| Charitable works | Poor of London | +0.058 | Synergistic |
| Traumatizing | Dr. Lanyon | -0.741 | Predatory |
| Resisting Hyde | Society | +0.058 | Altruistic |

## Background

- Born to a large fortune, Henry Jekyll was a brilliant physician who felt the burden of his "dual nature"—the conflict between his high social aspirations and his secret vices. This led him to experiment with transcendental medicine to separate these two selves.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Scientific curiosity, desire for social freedom, and later, fear of discovery and death.
- **Philosophy:** Dualism—the belief that man is "not truly one, but truly two."
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** N/A (Deceased).

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** Close friendship with Utterson and Lanyon.
- **Betrayal Risks:** High. He deceived his closest friends for years to protect his vice.
- **Loyalty Forecast:** Unreliable due to his addiction to Hyde.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** High social intelligence; scientific expertise.
- **Tech Use:** Advanced chemical synthesis.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Jekyll leaves a cautionary legacy regarding the dangers of repressing one's nature and the catastrophic potential of unchecked scientific ambition.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Maintain Transparency:** Do not hide significant parts of one's nature; integration is safer than separation.
2. **Seek Help:** Jekyll's isolation exacerbated his downfall; he should have confided in Utterson earlier.
3. **Ethical Science:** Consider the moral implications of experiments before conducting them on oneself.
4. **Monitor Addiction:** Recognize the signs of dependency (on the drug/persona) and intervene early.

## Consent Indicators (observations mapped to references)

- "I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Suffering Indicators (observations mapped to references)

- "I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Evidence References

- "Man is not truly one, but truly two" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Notes and Assumptions

- Assumed that Jekyll's "charitable works" involved a significant number of people (estimated 100) to generate the positive score.
- Assumed Lanyon's death was a direct consequence of the trauma inflicted by Jekyll, hence the high negative score.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- **Confidence:** High. The text provides explicit details on Jekyll's internal state and actions.

## Historical Impact

- Jekyll's case serves as a primary case study in the UMQF database for "Destructive Duality," illustrating the high fidelity risk of entities that attempt to fracture their moral agency.
