## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0.0% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.00 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +0.000 (0.0% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -3.717 (100.0% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Edward Hyde is described as "pure evil," a being "inherently malign and villainous." Unlike other humans who are a commingling of good and evil, Hyde is the distilled essence of the lower, selfish, and cruel elements of Henry Jekyll's soul. He acts without conscience, deriving "glee" from inflicting pain and terror. He is parasitic, predatory, and devoid of empathy.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 0% beneficial. He represents a lethal threat to any entity he encounters.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. Hyde exists to act out the dark impulses Jekyll suppresses.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He feels "younger, lighter, happier" in his wickedness and tastes "delight from every blow."
- **Inhibition Reliability:** None. He is defined by the absence of inhibition.
- **Gap Analysis:** None. His internal desires and external actions are perfectly aligned in their malevolence.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.5600
- **Rationale:** While described as "troglodytic" and "ape-like," Hyde possesses a sharp, cunning intelligence ("faculties seemed sharpened to a point"). He is capable of complex planning (renting a house, writing letters, mixing drugs) but lacks the higher moral/social adaptation of a complete human.

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** The dark, foggy streets of London; Soho.
- **Resource:** Access to Jekyll's fortune and resources.
- **Social:** Universally reviled; generates an immediate, instinctual loathing in everyone he meets.
- **Risk Levels:** Extreme. A murderer who kills for pleasure or out of minor irritation.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** A source of terror and "public injury."
- **Non-human Life:** Likely cruel to animals (implied by his nature), though text focuses on humans.
- **Trust Implications:** His existence undermines the social contract and the assumption of basic human decency.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- Any interaction is likely to result in physical harm or extreme psychological distress. He cannot be reasoned with or appealed to for mercy.

## Background

- Edward Hyde has no independent origin; he is the projected evil side of Henry Jekyll, brought into physical existence by a chemical tincture. He is "smaller, slighter and younger" than Jekyll because Jekyll's evil side was less developed than his good.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Self-preservation, sadism, uninhibited indulgence of vice.
- **Philosophy:** Solipsistic hedonism. "His every act and thought centered on self."
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** N/A (Deceased).

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** None. He hates Jekyll and fears him only as the power that can end his life.
- **Betrayal Risks:** Absolute. He burns his creator's letters and destroys his possessions out of spite.
- **Loyalty Forecast:** None.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** High. He is "astute" and quick to act in self-preservation (e.g., bribing the family, hiding evidence).
- **Tech Use:** Capable of using Jekyll's laboratory and chemical equipment.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Hyde leaves no legacy but horror and the destruction of the man who created him.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. Avoid all contact.
2. If contact is unavoidable, flee immediately; do not attempt to reason or negotiate.
3. Containment requires overwhelming force, as he is dangerous when cornered.

## Consent Indicators

- "I smote her in the face, and she fled" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Suffering Indicators

- "A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "He loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Evidence References

- "Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred" (Stevenson, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Notes and Assumptions

- Hyde is treated as a distinct entity for UMQF scoring due to his separate consciousness and memory, despite sharing a body with Jekyll.
- His suicide is scored as a negative action against the shared organism (Jekyll), as it destroyed the life of the host.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- Confidence in action analysis is High.
- Confidence in VSA scoring is Medium-High.

## Historical Impact

- Hyde is the archetype of the "Evil Twin" or "Dark Side," illustrating the dangers of unfettered id.
