## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0.0%
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.00
- **Positive (Good):** +0.00 (0% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -4.172 (100% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Edward Hyde is the distilled essence of evil, separated from the conscience of Dr. Jekyll. He is defined by pure selfishness, cruelty, and a complete lack of empathy. His actions are impulsive and violent, driven solely by his own desires and fears. He represents the "lower elements" of human nature unchecked by moral restraint.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% Destructive. Hyde is incapable of moral action; he is a "child of Hell" who exists only to satisfy his own lusts and rage.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. Hyde feels "glee" and "delight" when inflicting pain (e.g., murdering Carew).
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He revels in his crimes, feeling a "transport of glee" during the acts.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** None. He has no inhibition control; he acts immediately on every dark impulse.
- **Gap Analysis:** There is no gap; his internal desire for evil is perfectly matched by his external actions.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.75
- **Rationale:** Despite his bestial nature, Hyde shares Jekyll's intellect and memories, displaying cunning, planning, and a sharp instinct for self-preservation.

### Ability Notes

- Recognition: 0.11 (Complex)
- Solving: 0.12 (Advanced)
- Simulation: 0.13 (Advanced)
- Planning: 0.13 (Advanced)
- Adaptation: 0.06 (Advanced)
- Communication: 0.12 (Advanced)
- Actions: 0.08 (Advanced)

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** Operates in the shadows of London, using Jekyll's resources but frequenting disreputable areas.
- **Resource:** Parasitic. Relies entirely on Jekyll's wealth and protection.
- **Social:** Universally reviled; his mere presence causes physical revulsion in others.
- **Risk Levels:** Extreme. A lethal threat to anyone he encounters.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** Terrorized the streets; caused a scandal involving a prominent MP.
- **Non-human Life:** N/A
- **Trust Implications:** Represents the ultimate betrayal of social trust—a monster hiding behind a gentleman's facade.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- Any interaction with Hyde would be extremely dangerous. He reacts to innocence with cruelty (trampling the child) and to politeness with murder (Carew). Avoidance is the only survival strategy.

## Key Actions

| Action | Target | Score | Interaction Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trampling | Child | -0.0037 | Predatory |
| Murdering | Sir Danvers Carew | -2.16 | Destructive |
| Striking | Match-Seller | -0.0016 | Predatory |
| Tormenting | Jekyll | -0.027 | Predatory |
| Suicide | Self & Jekyll | -1.98 | Destructive |

## Background

- Edward Hyde is not a natural being but the product of Dr. Jekyll's experiment. He is the physical manifestation of Jekyll's evil side, smaller and younger because that side was less developed. He has no history or family other than Jekyll.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Hedonism, sadism, and self-preservation.
- **Philosophy:** Solipsism—he cares for nothing but himself.
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** N/A (Deceased).

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** None. He hates Jekyll and fears the gallows.
- **Betrayal Risks:** Absolute. He would betray anyone to save himself.
- **Loyalty Forecast:** None.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** Cunning, quick reflexes, and the ability to disappear into the city.
- **Tech Use:** Uses Jekyll's keys and bank accounts.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Hyde leaves a legacy of pure horror. He is the archetype of the "monster within," a warning of what lies beneath the surface of civilization.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Immediate Flight:** Do not attempt to reason with or confront Hyde.
2. **Alert Authorities:** He is a dangerous criminal who must be apprehended by force.
3. **Do Not Corner:** Like a trapped rat, he is most dangerous when cornered.
4. **Trust Instincts:** If you feel the "shudder" of his presence, trust that warning and leave.

## Consent Indicators (observations mapped to references)

- "He smote her in the face, and she fled" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "The man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Suffering Indicators (observations mapped to references)

- "With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Evidence References

- "Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).
- "That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred" (Stevenson, *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, 1886).

## Notes and Assumptions

- Assumed Hyde shares Jekyll's VSA scores due to shared memory and intellect, though his application of them is purely malicious.
- The suicide score includes the destruction of Jekyll, as they share a body.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- **Confidence:** High. Hyde's nature is explicitly defined as "pure evil" in the text.

## Historical Impact

- Hyde is the definitive case of "Predatory/Destructive" interaction class, serving as the baseline for maximum moral efficiency failure (0%).
