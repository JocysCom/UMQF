## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 100.00% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Constructive Perfect
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 7.06 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +10,000,005 (100.00% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -0.87 (0.00% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Noah is defined by a singular, monumental act of obedience and preservation that saved terrestrial life from extinction. His "righteousness" is characterized by long-term planning and execution under divine instruction. The only negative mark is the cursing of his grandson Canaan, which reflects a patriarchal punitive response to a personal violation (Ham's act), but this is negligible compared to the scale of his preservation efforts.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% beneficial (savior of species); 100% reliable in crisis.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. He simulated the flood and the need for the ark correctly based on divine warning.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He "did all that God commanded him."
- **Inhibition Reliability:** High. He persisted in building the ark despite likely social pressure or lack of immediate evidence (rain).
- **Gap Analysis:** None.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.58
- **Rationale:** Standard advanced human capabilities. Exceptional planning and construction skills.
