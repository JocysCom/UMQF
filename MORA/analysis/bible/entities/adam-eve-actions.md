## Case: 1. Adam & Eve - Eating Forbidden Fruit - Self & Humanity

### 1 Adam & Eve - loss of immortality

Context: Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, violating God's command and resulting in their expulsion from Eden and loss of immortality.

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.00 × 1.0 × 1.5 = **-0.435**

Total for 2 people: **-0.87**

### 2 Humanity (Future generations) - inherited mortality

Context: The transgression of Adam and Eve introduced sin and death into the world, affecting all future generations with mortality and separation from the divine.

- Population: 10,000,000,000 (All future humans)
- ΔOS = -0.50 (Loss of potential immortality)
- VSA (Advanced) = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent of descendants)
- Sc = 0.50

sign(ΔOS) = -1
[1 - (-1) × Vc] = 2.0
[1 - (-1) × Sc] = 1.5

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.50 × 0.58 × 1.00 × 2.0 × 1.5 = **-0.87**

**Responsibility & Intention:**
- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 0.5 (Direct Consequence - genetic/spiritual inheritance)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique progenitors)
- Rp = 1.0 × 0.5 × 1.0 = **0.5**
- In = 0.5 (Foreseeable negligence - warned of death, but likely didn't comprehend scope)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.87 × 0.5 × 0.5 = **-0.2175**
Total (scaled for massive population): -0.2175 × 10,000,000,000 = **-2,175,000,000**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Adam & Eve: -0.87
- Humanity: -2,175,000,000
- **Total: -2,175,000,000.87**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.2 (Theological complexity, "Original Sin" mechanics). Adjusted Total UMQ = **-2,610,000,001**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Adam/Eve) ≈ +0.10 (Gaining wisdom, becoming "like gods").
- UMQ_realised(a, Adam/Eve) ≈ -0.90 (Death, toil, pain, expulsion).

### Summary headline

Adam & Eve - Eating Forbidden Fruit - Self & Humanity: Total UMQ = -2,610,000,001 [Catastrophically immoral] {Destructive}
