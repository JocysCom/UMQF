## Identification

- ID: E0002
- Name: Adam & Eve
- Type: human
- Role tags: actor | victim
- Time Period: Creation/Eden
- Document: Bible
- Reviewer: Roo

## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0.00% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.00 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +0.00 (0.00% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -2,610,000,001 (100.00% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Adam and Eve represent the archetypal first humans who failed a critical test of obedience, prioritizing immediate desire and curiosity over long-term consequences and divine command. Their failure demonstrates a vulnerability to deception and a lack of foresight regarding the catastrophic cascading effects of their actions. While not malicious, their negligence was species-defining.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 10% beneficial (as progenitors); 90% risky (prone to deception and critical failure).

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. They did not simulate the harm; they simulated the benefit ("good for food", "make one wise").
- **Action Alignment:** Penalty. Immediate shame and fear followed the action.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. Failed to inhibit action against the only prohibition in their environment.
- **Gap Analysis:** Massive gap between the perceived benefit (wisdom) and the actual outcome (death/suffering).

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.58
- **Rationale:** Demonstrates advanced human capabilities, including language, naming (classification), and understanding of abstract concepts like "good and evil" (post-fall).

### Ability Notes

- Recognition: 0.07 (Advanced)
- Solving: 0.095 (Advanced)
- Simulation: 0.105 (Advanced)
- Planning: 0.105 (Advanced)
- Adaptation: 0.045 (Advanced)
- Communication: 0.095 (Advanced)
- Actions: 0.065 (Advanced)

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** Originally a paradise (Eden) with abundant resources, transitioning to a hostile environment requiring toil.
- **Resource:** Shift from post-scarcity to scarcity.
- **Social:** The first nuclear family; origin of human social structure.
- **Risk Levels:** Extreme. Their actions determined the fate of the entire species.

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** Defined the human condition (mortality, labor, gender roles).
- **Non-human Life:** Cursed the ground; introduced disharmony.
- **Trust Implications:** Low trust in human ability to maintain perfection or obey simple commands without error.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- A reader should approach with caution, recognizing that they are easily influenced and may not fully grasp the consequences of their actions. They require clear, enforced boundaries.

## Key Actions

| Action | Target | Score | Interaction Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Eating Forbidden Fruit | Self & Humanity (10B) | -2,610,000,001 | Destructive |

## Background

- **Biography:** Created by God in the Garden of Eden. Adam was formed from dust; Eve from Adam's rib. They were expelled after disobeying God's command not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
- **Origin:** Direct creation by God.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Curiosity, Desire for Wisdom, Hunger, Social bonding (Adam eating to be with Eve).
- **Philosophy:** Naive Empiricism (Testing reality against authority).
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** Likely to struggle with hardship but seek redemption/restoration.

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** Strong bond with each other; strained but enduring relationship with God.
- **Betrayal Risks:** High susceptibility to external manipulation (e.g., Serpent).
- **Loyalty Forecast:** Variable.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** Low initially (provided for), forced to develop High skills (agriculture/clothing) post-expulsion.
- **Tech Use:** Basic (Clothing from leaves/skins).

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- **Future predictions:** Their legacy is the "Fall of Man," influencing all subsequent human history, theology, and existential philosophy.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Enforce Protocols:** Do not rely on verbal warnings alone; implement physical barriers to critical risks.
2. **Verify Information:** Do not accept third-party claims (like the Serpent's) without verification.
3. **Monitor Compliance:** Regular checks are necessary to ensure adherence to safety rules.
4. **Mitigate Fallout:** Have a containment plan for when human error inevitably occurs.

## Consent Indicators

- "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food... she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat." (Bible, Genesis 3:6).

## Suffering Indicators

- "Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children." (Bible, Genesis 3:16).
- "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." (Bible, Genesis 3:19).

## Evidence References

- "Genesis" (Bible, *King James Version*, 1611).

## Notes and Assumptions

- **Assumptions:** The population of "Humanity" is estimated at 10 billion for the purpose of calculating the impact of inherited mortality.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- **Confidence:** High. The narrative is the foundational text for these entities.

## Historical Impact

- **Summary:** The progenitors of the human race in Abrahamic tradition.
