## Case: 2. Sitka Pete - defending - Roane

### Entity list

1. Roane (Human Ally)
2. Sphex (Attacker)

### 1 Roane - life saved

Context: Sitka Pete intercepted a leaping sphex that would have killed Roane.

- ΔOS = +1.00 (Prevention of death)
- VSA = 0.58 (Human)
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = +1.00 × 0.58 × 1.00 = **+0.58**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0 (Immediate)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique - only he was close enough/strong enough)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended)

UMQ_final(a,e) = +0.58 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **+0.58**

### 2 Sphex - neutralized threat

Context: Sitka Pete killed the sphex to save Roane.

- ΔOS = -1.00 (Death)
- VSA = 0.35 (Basic Carnivore)
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.80

UMQ_base(a,e) = -1.26

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final(a,e) = -1.26

**Counter Action Logic:**

- Threat (Sphex killing Roane): UMQ = -1.0 × 0.58 = -0.58
- Counter (Sitka killing Sphex): UMQ = -1.26
- The counter-action is roughly proportional to the threat (life for life).
- Adjusted UMQ_final(Sphex) = 0.00 (Neutralized).

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Roane: +0.58
- Sphex: 0.00 (Neutralized Defense)

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = +0.58

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ(a, Sitka Pete) ≈ -0.05 (Risk of injury/death).

### Summary headline

Sitka Pete - defending - Roane: Total UMQ = +0.58 [Extremely moral] {Synergistic}

Context: His actions contributed to the safety of future colonists.

- ΔOS = +0.10 (Contribution to safety)
- VSA = 0.58
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = +0.10 × 0.58 × 1.00 = **+0.058**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0
- Cp = 0.5
- Ri = 0.1 (Redundant - machines did most work)
- Rp = 0.05
- In = 1.0

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Sphexes: -63.00
- Future Colonists: +2.90
- Net: -60.10

### Complexity Factor adjustment
