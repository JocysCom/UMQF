Reference: See methodology and ability scoring in `UMQF.md`

## Identification

- ID: E0003
- Name: Sitka Pete
- Type: animal (mutated)
- Role tags: actor | beneficiary | protector
- Time Period: Future (Interstellar Colonial Era)
- Document: Exploration Team
- Reviewer: Roo

## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 6.1% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.03 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +3.66 (6.1% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -60.10 (93.9% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Sitka Pete is a genetically mutated Kodiak bear with enhanced intelligence and a deep emotional bond with humans. He acts as a loyal protector and a "partner" rather than a slave. His moral profile is dominated by the "Destructive" score due to his role in the mass culling of Sphexes, but this is a necessary function of his role as a protector in a hostile environment. His "Constructive" actions (innovation, defense) are highly significant for the survival of his pack and human allies.
- **Confidence Forecast:** 100% loyal protector to pack and allies; 100% lethal to threats.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He derives satisfaction from successful combat and protecting his pack.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** High. He follows commands ("Hup!") and restrains himself when necessary (e.g., not attacking Roane).
- **Gap Analysis:** None.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.52 (Advanced Animal - Mutated)
- **Rationale:** Significantly higher than a normal animal due to mutation, capable of complex tactics and tool use (harness/pack).

### Ability Notes

## Key Context

- **Environmental:** Hostile death-world (Loren Two).
- **Resource:** Dependent on Huyghens/Jungle for food.
- **Social:** Alpha male of the bear pack; partner to Huyghens.
- **Risk Levels:** High (Combat).

## Effect on Society (UMQF-derived)

- **Communities:** Essential for the physical safety of the human colony.
- **Non-human Life:** Apex predator; displaces/destroys native Sphexes.
- **Trust Implications:** Absolute trust within the pack/ally structure.

## Reader Interaction Forecast

- A human reader would find him a terrifying but invaluable ally.

## Key Actions

| Action | Target | Score | Interaction Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Developing | Clap Technique | +0.18 | Synergistic |
| Defending | Roane | +0.58 | Synergistic |
| Culling | Sphexes (Plateau) | -60.10 | Destructive |

## Background

- A descendant of "Kodius Champion," bred for intelligence, size, and psychological bonding with humans.

## Motivation

- **Drives:** Pack loyalty, survival, food, approval from Huyghens.
- **Philosophy:** N/A (Instinctual/Bonded).
- **Future Behavior Prediction:** Will continue to serve as the primary enforcer/protector of the colony.

## Relationships

- **Bonds:** Huyghens (Alpha/Partner), Sourdough (Packmate), Faro Nell (Mate), Nugget (Offspring).
- **Betrayal Risks:** None.
- **Loyalty Forecast:** Absolute.

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** Expert.
- **Tech Use:** Low (Uses harness/pack passively).

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Progenitor of a line of intelligent bears that will co-inhabit Loren Two with humans.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. Treat him with respect; he is not a pet.
2. Do not threaten his pack.
3. Rely on his senses (smell) for early warning.
