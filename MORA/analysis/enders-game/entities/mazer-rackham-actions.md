# Mazer Rackham - Actions Analysis

## Case: 1. Mazer - training/deception - Ender

### Entity list

1. Ender (Student/Tool)
2. Humanity (Beneficiary)
3. Buggers (Victims)

### 1 Ender - physical and psychological abuse

Context: Mazer physically attacked and psychologically pressured Ender during training, using deception to harden him for the final battle.

- ΔOS = -0.20 (Extreme exhaustion, physical attacks, psychological pressure, deception)
- VSA(Ender) = 0.60
- Tc = 0.20 (Duration of training)
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent to the deception and abuse)
- Sc = 0.80 (Pain, despair, nightmares)

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.20 × 0.60 × 0.20 × 2.0 × 1.8 = **-0.0864**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique teacher)
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended to break/harden him)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.0864 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **-0.0864**

### 2 Humanity - salvation

Context: Mazer's training enabled Ender to win the war, saving humanity from extinction.

- ΔOS = +1.00
- VSA = 0.55
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = +1.00 × 0.55 × 1.00 = **+0.55**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final(a,e) = +0.55
Group size: ~100 Billion. Total = **+55,000,000,000**

### 3 Buggers - xenocide

Context: Mazer's training and deception led to the xenocide of the Bugger species.

- ΔOS = -1.00
- VSA = 0.90
- Tc = 1.00
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 1.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = -3.60

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended to destroy them via Ender)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -3.60
Group size: 1000 Queens. Total = **-3,600**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Ender: -0.0864
- Humanity: +55,000,000,000
- Buggers: -3,600

**Total UMQ = +54,999,996,396.3**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 0.8. Adjusted Total UMQ = **+43,999,997,117**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ(a, Mazer) ≈ -0.10 (Living in isolation, burden of the past and present).

### Summary headline

Mazer - training/deception - Ender: Total UMQ = +43,999,997,117 [Extremely moral] {Altruistic}
