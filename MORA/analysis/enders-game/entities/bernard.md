## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0.0%
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.0
- **Positive (Good):** +0.0000 (0% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -0.0114 (100% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Bernard is a classic bully who relies on physical intimidation and social exclusion to establish dominance. He lacks the strategic intelligence to maintain leadership when challenged by superior tactics and intellect. His moral compass is skewed towards predatory behavior, seeking status at the expense of others.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 90% harmful/predatory. Bernard consistently chooses actions that harm others to boost his own ego.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward (Satisfaction from imagining dominance).
- **Action Alignment:** Reward (Pleasure from exerting power over weaker peers).
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low - He acts on aggressive impulses readily until checked by force or humiliation.
- **Gap Analysis:** None detected.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.33
- **Rationale:** While intelligent enough to be in Battle School, Bernard demonstrates "Basic" to low "Advanced" capabilities compared to the genius of Ender or Bean, relying on brute force rather than complex planning.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bullying Ender | Ender | -0.0096 | Predatory |

## Resource and Environmental Adaptation

- **Survival Skills:** Physical aggression, social exclusion tactics.

## Long-Term Impact and Legacy Forecast

- Bernard serves as an early obstacle for Ender but fades into the background as a competent but unremarkable soldier once his bullying is neutralized.

## Actionable Recommendations

4. Use superior tactics to neutralize his physical advantage.

## Consent Indicators

## Evidence References
