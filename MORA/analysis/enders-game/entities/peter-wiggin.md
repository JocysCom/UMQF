## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Peter Wiggin is a complex figure who embodies the paradox of "doing good through bad means" or "ambition serving the world." He is sadistic in his personal life (torturing animals, bullying siblings) but channels his immense intellect and drive for power into saving the world from self-destruction (The Locke Proposal). He is a sociopath who chooses to be a savior because it is the most effective path to the power he craves.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward (Pleasure from imagining pain/dominance).
- **Action Alignment:** Reward (Satisfaction from power).

- **Gap Analysis:** Significant gap between his sadistic nature and his constructive political actions.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary
