## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 0.00% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.00 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +0.00 (0.00% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -0.3988 (100.00% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Sarah is a matriarch driven by the desire for a legitimate heir and the security of her own status. While she is a beneficiary of God's protection and Abraham's wealth, her recorded actions towards Hagar and Ishmael are characterized by jealousy, harshness, and exclusion. She prioritizes the "chosen" line (Isaac) by actively removing threats, demonstrating a ruthless protective instinct for her own biological legacy.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% loyal to her own son; 0% tolerant of rivals.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. She simulates the threat Ishmael poses to Isaac's inheritance and acts to neutralize it.
- **Action Alignment:** Reward/Relief. She feels relief/satisfaction when the rival is removed ("Cast out this bondwoman").
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. She acts on jealousy and anger ("My wrong be upon thee").
- **Gap Analysis:** None. She intends to harm/expel and does so.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.58
- **Rationale:** Standard advanced human capabilities.
