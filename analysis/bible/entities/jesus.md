## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 99.99% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Highly Constructive Saintly
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 6.08 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +953,522,016 (99.99% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -791.57 (0.01% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Jesus represents the pinnacle of moral action within the text, consistently prioritizing the welfare of others (healing, feeding, teaching) over self-preservation. His actions are characterized by high-impact altruism (self-sacrifice for mass benefit) and synergistic healing. The only significant negative score arises from the destruction of the swine herd during an exorcism, which prioritizes human sanity over animal life and property. His ultimate act (Crucifixion) generates immense positive value through the theological mechanism of salvation for billions.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 100% beneficial to humanity; 100% reliable in moral consistency.

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Reward. He consistently simulates and enacts scenarios that maximize well-being (healing, forgiveness).
- **Action Alignment:** Reward. He expresses joy and purpose in doing the Father's will, which aligns with benevolence.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** High. He resists temptation (wilderness) and the impulse to save himself from the cross, demonstrating perfect inhibition of self-preservation instincts for higher moral goals.
- **Gap Analysis:** None. Actions perfectly align with stated intent.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.58 (Human Baseline) / 1.00 (Divine Nature)
- **Rationale:** As a human, he demonstrates advanced capabilities. As divine, he possesses maximum complexity. Scored as human (0.58) for standard interaction, but effects imply higher power.
