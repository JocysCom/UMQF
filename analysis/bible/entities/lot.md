## Identification

## UMQ Score Summary

- **Moral Efficiency Score:** 33.79% (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Moral Efficiency Label:** Destructive Hazardous
- **Moral Fidelity Score:** 0.18 (Logarithmic score of integrity: -log10(1-Efficiency))
- **Positive (Good):** +0.90 (33.79% of total magnitude)
- **Negative (Evil):** -1.76 (66.21% of total magnitude)

## Executive Summary

- **Character Analysis:** Lot is a conflicted figure who attempts to uphold the sacred duty of hospitality in a hostile environment (Sodom) but does so by offering his own daughters to a violent mob. This extreme prioritization of guest rights over family safety reveals a rigid, perhaps desperate, moral hierarchy that results in severe harm to his dependents.
- **Confidence Forecast:** Forecast: 50% beneficial (to guests); 100% dangerous (to family in crisis).

## Simulation & Inhibition Analysis

- **Simulation Alignment:** Neutral. He simulates the protection of guests as the highest good, seemingly blocking out the simulation of his daughters' suffering.
- **Action Alignment:** Penalty. He is distressed by the mob ("do not so wickedly"), suggesting he takes no pleasure in the situation.
- **Inhibition Reliability:** Low. He fails to inhibit the impulse to sacrifice his daughters, lacking a balanced protective instinct.
- **Gap Analysis:** Gap between his intent to be righteous (hospitable) and the horrific nature of his proposed solution.

## VSA (Value of Self-Awareness) Summary

- **Total VSA:** 0.58
- **Rationale:** Standard advanced human capabilities.

## Notes and Assumptions

- **Assumptions:** Standard human VSA.

## Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

## Assumptions & Confidence

- **Confidence:** High.

## Historical Impact

- **Summary:** A cautionary figure of compromise and the limits of hospitality.
