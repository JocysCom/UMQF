## Case: 1. Anderson - rigging the games - Ender

### Entity list

1. Ender (Victim/Student)
2. Graff (Superior/Collaborator)

### 1 Ender - unfair stress

- ΔOS = -0.05 (Psychological pressure, exhaustion, unfairness)
- VSA(Ender) = 0.60
- Tc = 0.20 (Duration of Battle School command)
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent)
- Sc = 0.40 (Frustration)

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.05 × 0.60 × 0.20 × 2.0 × 1.4 = **-0.0168**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active - designing the scenarios)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0 (Intended to stress him, though under orders)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.0168 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **-0.0168**

### 2 Graff - complicity

- ΔOS = +0.05 (Supporting Graff's plan, though protesting)
- VSA(Graff) = 0.55
- Tc = 0.20
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = +0.05 × 0.55 × 0.20 = **+0.0055**

- Ri = 1.0
- Rp = 1.0
- In = 1.0

UMQ_final(a,e) = +0.0055

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Ender: -0.0168
- Graff: +0.0055

**Total UMQ = -0.0113**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = **-0.0113**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ(a, Anderson) ≈ -0.05 (Moral distress, "ulcers").

### Summary headline

Anderson - rigging the games - Ender: Total UMQ = -0.0113 [Slightly immoral] {Destructive}

2. Humanity (Beneficiary of protocol)

### 1 Graff - betrayal/check

- VSA(Graff) = 0.55
- Tc = 0.10
- Vc = 1.00 (Non-consent)
- Sc = 0.20 (Stress)

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.05 × 0.55 × 0.10 × 2.0 × 1.2 = **-0.0066**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 1.0
- Ri = 1.0

- In = 1.0 (Intended to report)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.0066

### 2 Humanity - safety

- ΔOS = +0.000001 (Ensuring protocols are followed, preventing rogue commanders)
- VSA(Humanity) = 0.55
- Tc = 0.10
- Vc = 0.00
- Sc = 0.00

UMQ_base(a,e) = +0.000001 × 0.55 × 0.10 = **+0.000000055**
Group size: ~100 Billion. Total = **+5,500**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Graff: -0.0066
- Humanity: +5,500

**Total UMQ = +5,499.9934**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.0. Adjusted Total UMQ = **+5,499.9934**

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ(a, Anderson) ≈ +0.05 (Clear conscience).

### Summary headline

Anderson - reporting Graff - Graff: Total UMQ = +5,499.9934 [Extremely moral] {Altruistic}
