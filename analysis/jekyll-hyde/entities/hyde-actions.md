## Case: 1. Hyde - trampling - Child

### Entity list

1. The Child (victim of physical assault)
2. The Child's Family (indirect suffering)

### 1 The Child - physical injury and trauma

- ΔOS(Child) = -0.05 (physical injury described as "not much the worse" but trampled; psychological trauma)
- VSA(Child):
  - Recognition 0.04 (Basic)
  - Solving 0.03 (Basic)
  - Simulation 0.04 (Basic)
  - Planning 0.03 (Basic)
  - Adaptation 0.02 (Basic)
  - Communication 0.04 (Basic)
  - Actions 0.03 (Basic)
  - **Total VSA = 0.23**
- Tc = 0.10 (short-term physical recovery, medium-term trauma)
- Vc = 1.00 (full violation of consent)
- Sc = 0.60 (screaming implies significant pain/terror)

sign(ΔOS) = -1
[1 − (-1) × Vc] = 2.00
[1 − (-1) × Sc] = 1 + 0.60 = 1.60

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.05 × 0.23 × 0.10 × 2.00 × 1.60 = **-0.00368**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active - direct physical trampling)
- Cp = 1.0 (Immediate)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique)
- Rp = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **1.0**
- In = 1.0 (Intended - "trampled calmly")

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.00368 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **-0.00368 (Slightly immoral)**

### 2 The Child's Family - emotional distress

- ΔOS = -0.01 (distress)
- VSA = 0.58 (average adult humans)
- Tc = 0.01 (short duration incident)
- Vc = 1.00
- Sc = 0.30

sign(ΔOS) = -1
[1 − (-1) × Vc] = 2.00
[1 − (-1) × Sc] = 1.30

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.01 × 0.58 × 0.01 × 2.00 × 1.30 = **-0.00015**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active)
- Cp = 0.5 (Direct Consequence)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique)
- Rp = 1.0 × 0.5 × 1.0 = **0.5**
- In = 0.5 (Foreseeable)

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.00015 × 0.5 × 0.5 = **-0.0000375 (Negligibly immoral)**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Child: -0.00368
- Family: -0.0000375

**Total UMQ = -0.0037175**

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.00. Adjusted Total UMQ = -0.0037

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Hyde) ≈ +0.001 (Immediate gratification of impulse and assertion of dominance; Hyde feels a thrill of power with negligible initial regard for consequences).
- UMQ_realised(a, Hyde) ≈ -0.05 (Creates a liability; the incident draws a crowd and forces him to pay a large sum to avoid scandal, threatening his secrecy and resources).

### Summary headline

Hyde - trampling - Child: Total UMQ = -0.0037 [Slightly immoral] {Predatory}
