## Case: 1. Jekyll - creating potion - Society

### Entity list

1. Society (Indirect victim of Hyde's release)

### 1 Society - unleashing a predator

- ΔOS(Society) = -0.01 (Introduction of a murderer/monster)
- VSA(Society) = 0.58 (Average)
- Tc = 0.20 (Duration of Hyde's terror)
- Vc = 1.00 (No consent)
- Sc = 0.50 (Fear/Harm caused by Hyde)

sign(ΔOS) = -1
[1 − (-1) × Vc] = 2.00
[1 − (-1) × Sc] = 1.50

UMQ_base(a,e) = -0.01 × 0.58 × 0.20 × 2.00 × 1.50 = **-0.00348**

**Responsibility & Intention:**

- PerceivedContext = Real
- ActualContext = Real
- At = 1.0 (Active - synthesized and took drug)
- Cp = 0.5 (Direct Consequence - Hyde is the direct actor, Jekyll enabled him)
- Ri = 1.0 (Unique)
- Rp = 1.0 × 0.5 × 1.0 = **0.5**
- In = 0.5 (Foreseeable - knew he was unleashing "lower elements")

UMQ_final(a,e) = -0.00348 × 0.5 × 0.5 = **-0.00087 (Negligibly immoral)**

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)

- Society: -0.00087

### Complexity Factor adjustment

CF = 1.10 (Unintended consequences of a new scientific frontier). Adjusted Total UMQ = -0.00096

### Actor (self) impact

- UMQ_expected(a, Jekyll) ≈ +0.10 (Anticipated liberation from social constraints and the joy of scientific discovery; Jekyll expects to safely indulge his dual nature).
- UMQ_realised(a, Jekyll) ≈ -0.90 (Complete loss of control, addiction to the transformation, and eventual destruction of his life and soul).

### Summary headline

Jekyll - creating potion - Society: Total UMQ = -0.00096 [Negligibly immoral] {Destructive}
