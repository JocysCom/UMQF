**Net Assessment:**
While Kistler was destroyed (-1.20), the benefit to the broader industry and the US taxpayer (opening up fixed-price contracts vs cost-plus) was massive. If we scale the Industry benefit by the number of future launches and companies saved/created (SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc.), the positive impact dwarfs the negative.
*   **Estimated Industry Impact Factor**: 100x (Transformational change).
*   **Adjusted Industry UMQ**: +8.0.

### Aggregate results (pre-CF)
*   US Space Industry: +8.0

*   Total: +6.80

### Complexity Factor adjustment
CF = 1.1 (Legal complexity). Adjusted Total UMQ = +7.48

### Actor (self) impact
*   **UMQ_realised(a, Musk)**: High Positive. Saved SpaceX by allowing it to bid for and win NASA contracts.
