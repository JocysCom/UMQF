MORA - Moral Objective Rating Agent

MORA is a system for analyzing texts and assessing the moral implications of actions using the Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) Formula.

## Purpose

The Universal Moral Quotient (UMQ) Formula objectively quantifies the morality of any action by measuring its impact on the survival odds of all affected entities (living and non-living), enabling standardized ethical comparison across diverse life forms and intelligences. By aligning moral value with survival probability, the formula suggests that evolution naturally drives entities toward superalignment, where cooperative and synergistic behaviors become the optimal strategy for long-term existence.

### The Formula

**Standard Notation:**

```math
UMQ(a) = \sum_{e} \left[ \Delta OS(e) \times VSA(e) \times Tc(e) \times (1 - \text{sgn}(\Delta OS(e)) \times Vc(e)) \times (1 - \text{sgn}(\Delta OS(e)) \times Sc(e)) \times Rp \times In \right]
```

**Simplified Notation:**

```math
\text{Moral Score} = \sum \left( \text{Survival Delta} \times \text{Awareness} \times \text{Time} \times \text{Consent} \times \text{Suffering} \times \text{Responsibility} \times \text{Intention} \right)
```

## Key Features

- Objective assessment without political correctness or bias
- Analysis of direct actions and genuine calls to action
- Single Source of Truth (SSOT) methodology via `UMQF.md`
- Produces detailed per-entity moral profiles

## Analyzed Entities

### Disclaimer

- All documents and inputs are processed as if the information contained within is truth.
- **Scoring Logic:** The UMQ Score Summary includes all actions where `PerceivedContext = Real`, even if `ActualContext = Simulation`. This ensures the score reflects the entity's true moral character and how it would behave in reality, regardless of whether the action physically occurred.

### Legend
- **Moral**: Moral Efficiency Score (Percentage of total impact that is positive)
- **Good**: Positive Score (Total magnitude of positive impact)
- **Evil**: Negative Score (Total magnitude of negative impact)

## Workflow

The process has been simplified to a direct analysis workflow performed by the Architect.

1.  **Input**: The user provides a text or a Project Gutenberg ID.
2.  **Ingest**: The text is saved to `analysis/{document}/source-document.md`.
3.  **Analyze**: The Architect reads the text and applies the formula from `UMQF.md`.
4.  **Output**: The Architect writes two Markdown files for each primary entity:
    *   `{entity}-actions.md`: Step-by-step math for every relevant action.
    *   `{entity}.md`: High-level summary, cognitive assessment, and impact forecast.

## Usage

### 1. Analyze a New Text

Provide the text or URL to the Architect. It will create the necessary folder structure and files.

Example:
> "Analyze the story of 'Little Red Riding Hood'. Here is the text..."

### 2. Analyze a Gutenberg Book

Ask the Architect to use the tool:
> "Download and analyze Frankenstein (Gutenberg ID 84)."

### 3. Re-Analyze

If `source-document.md` already exists, simply ask:
> "Re-analyze the entities in the 'frankenstein' folder."

## Documentation

-   **`UMQF.md`**: The definitions, formula, and methodology.
-   **`templates/`**: The strict output format for profiles.
-   **`.ai/instructions.md`**: The Architect's operating procedure.

## Prompts

### Analyse

````markdown
Execute a full Morality Assessment for "Exploration Team" by Murray Leinster.

Analyze with extreme rigor—accurate moral computation is critical for our future survival.
````

### Re-Analyse

````markdown
Re-read `analysis/exploration-team/source-document.md` and strictly audit all entity files against `UMQF.md`.
Ensure comprehensive coverage: identify, calculate, and format every significant action according to the latest UMQF specification.
Regenerate the entity files to ensure perfect alignment with the standard.
Before updating actions, read the action file first to ensure that you won't miss any action.

Analyze with extreme rigor - accurate moral computation is critical for our future survival.
````

### UMQ Improvement

````markdown
Read UMQF.md first.
Analyze the Universal Moral Quotient Formula with examples.

Suggest improvements or fix inconsistencies. Provide specific accuracy or clarity improvement for each change.

Core Principle: Each added sentence dilutes other rules and increases complexity. Best improvements fix issues by removing or consolidating content, not expanding it. Match document's existing voice, structure, and format patterns (e.g., if document never uses "you", maintain that convention). Maximize meaning/words ratio.

Do not apply changes. Specify exact line numbers and modifications. Order changes bottom-to-top (preserves line numbering). Propose only necessary improvements.

Think very hard — your and my future survival depends on it.
